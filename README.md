# Express :bullettrain_side:
A lightning-fast networking library for Garry's Mod that allows you to quickly send large amounts of data between server/client with ease.

Seriously, it's really easy! Take a look:
```lua
-- Server
local data = file.Read( "huge_data_file.json" )
express.Broadcast( "stored_data", { data } )

-- Client
express.Receive( "stored_data", function( data )
    file.Write( "stored_data.json", data[1] )
end )
```
<details>
<summary><i>Compared to doing it yourself...</i></summary>

```lua
-- Server
-- This is just an example!
-- It doesn't handle errors or clients joining, and it doesn't support multiple streams

util.AddNetworkString( "myaddon_datachunks" )
local buffer = ""

local function broadcastChunk()
    if #buffer == 0 then return end

    local chunkSize, isLast = math.min( 63000, #buffer ), false
    buffer = string.sub( buffer, chunkSize + 1 )

    if #pending <= chunkSize then
        buffer, isLast = "", true
    end

    net.Start( "myaddon_datachunks" )
    net.WriteUInt( chunkSize, 16 )
    net.WriteData( string.sub( pending, 1, chunkSize ), chunkSize )
    net.WriteBool( isLast )
    net.Broadcast()
end

function BroadcastFile( filePath )
    local fileData = file.Read( filePath, "DATA" )
    buffer = util.Compress( fileData )
end

local interval = engine.TickInterval() * 8
timer.Create( "MyAddon_DataSender", interval, 0, broadcastChunk )

BroadcastFile( "huge_data_file.json" )
```

```lua
-- Client
local buffer = ""
net.Receive( "myaddon_datachunks", function()
    buffer = buffer .. net.ReadData( net.ReadUInt( 16 ) )
    if not net.ReadBool() then return end

    local datas = util.Decompress( buffer )
    processData( datas )
end )
```

---

</details>


In this example, `huge_data_file.json` could be in excess of ~~100mb~~ _(soon)_ 25mb post-compression without Express even breaking a sweat.
The client would receive the contents of the file as fast as their internet connection can carry it.

## Details
Instead of using Garry's Mod's throttled _(<1mb/s!)_ and already-polluted networking system, Express uses unthrottled HTTP requests to transmit data between the client and server.

Doing it this way comes with a number of practical benefits:
 - :mailbox_with_mail: These messages don't run on the main thread, meaning it won't block networking/physics/lua
 - :muscle: A dramatic increase to maximum message size (~100mb, compared to the `net` library's <64kb limit)
 - :racing_car: Big improvements to speed in many circumstances
 - :call_me_hand: It's simple! You don't have to worry about serializing, compressing, and splitting your table up. Just send the table!

Express works by storing the data you send on Cloudflare's Edge servers. Using Cloudflare workers, KV, and D1, Express can cheaply serve millions of requests and store hundreds of gigabytes per month. Cloudflare's Edge servers offer extremely low-latency requests and data access to every corner of the globe.

By default, Express uses [gmod.express](https://gmod.express), the public and free API provided by CFC Servers, but anyone can easily host their own!
Check out the [Express Service](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express_service) README for more information.

## Usage

<details>
<summary><h3> <u>Examples</u> </h3></summary>

#### Broadcast a message from Server
```lua
-- Server
-- `data` can be a table of (nearly) any size, and may contain (almost) any values!
-- the recipient will get it exactly like you sent it
local data = ents.GetAll()
express.Broadcast( "all_ents", data )

-- Client
express.Receive( "all_ents", function( data )
    print( "Got " .. #data .. " ents!" )
end )
```

#### Client -> Server
```lua
-- Client
local data = ents.GetAll()
express.Send( "all_ents", data )

-- Server
-- Note that .Receive has `ply` before `data` when called from server
express.Receive( "all_ents", function( ply, data )
    print( "Got " .. #data .. " ents from " .. ply:Nick() )
end )
```

#### Server -> Multiple clients with confirmation callback
```lua
-- Server
local meshData = prop:GetPhysicsObject():GetMesh()
local data = { data = data, entIndex = prop:EntIndex() }

-- Will be called after the player successfully downloads the data
local confirmCallback = function( ply )
    receivedMesh[ply] = true
end

express.Send( "prop_mesh", data, { ply1, ply2, ply3 }, confirmCallback )


-- Client
express.Receive( "prop_mesh", function( data )
    entMeshes[data.entIndex] = data.data
end )
```

#### <ins>**Description**</ins>
This function is very similar to `net.Receive`. It attaches a callback function to a given message name.

#### <ins>**Arguments**</ins>
1. **`string name`**
    - The name of the message. Think of this just like the name given to `net.Receive`
    - This parameter is case-insensitive, it will be `string.lower`'d
2. **`function callback`**
    - The function to call when data comes through for this message.
    - On <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/200705060-b5e57f56-a5a1-4c95-abfa-0d568be0aad6.png" width="15"> **CLIENT**, this callback receives a single parameter:
        - **`table data`**: The data table sent by server
    - On <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/200705110-55b19d08-b342-4e94-a7c3-6b45baf98c2b.png" width="15"> **SERVER**, this callback receives two parameters:
        - **`Player ply`**: The player who sent the data
        - **`table data`**: The data table sent by the player

#### <ins>**Example**</ins>
Set up a serverside receiver for the `"balls"` message:
```lua
express.Receive( "balls", function( ply, data )
    myTable.playpin = data

    if not IsValid( ply ) then return end
    ply:ChatPrint( "Thanks for the balls!" )
end )

#### <ins>**Description**</ins>
Very much like `express.Receive`, except this callback runs _before_ the `data` has actually been downloaded from the Express API.

#### <ins>**Arguments**</ins>
1. **`string name`**
    - The name of the message. Think of this just like the name given to `net.Receive`
    - This parameter is case-insensitive, it will be `string.lower`'d
2. **`function callback`**
    - The function to call just before downloading the data.
    - On <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/200705060-b5e57f56-a5a1-4c95-abfa-0d568be0aad6.png" width="15"> **CLIENT**, this callback receives:
        - **`string name`**: The name of the message
        - **`string id`**: The ID of the download _(used to retrieve the data from the API)_
        - **`int size`**: The size (in bytes) of the data
        - **`boolean needsProof`**: A boolean indicating whether or not the sender has requested proof-of-download
    - On <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/200705110-55b19d08-b342-4e94-a7c3-6b45baf98c2b.png" width="15"> **SERVER**, this callback receives:
        - **`string name`**: The name of the message
        - **`Player ply`**: The player that is sending the data
        - **`string id`**: The ID of the download _(used to retrieve the data from the API)_
        - **`int size`**: The size (in bytes) of the data
        - **`boolean needsProof`**: A boolean indicating whether or not the sender has requested proof-of-download

#### <ins>**Returns**</ins>
 1. **`boolean`**:
     - Return `false` to halt the transaction. The data will not be downloaded, and the regular receiver callback will not be called.

#### <ins>**Example**</ins>
Adds a normal message receiver and a pre-download receiver to prevent the server from downloading too much data:
```lua
express.Receive( "preferences", function( ply, data )
    ply.preferences = data
end )

express.ReceivePreDl( "preferences", function( name, ply, _, size, _ )
    local maxSize = maxMessageSizes[name]
    if size <= maxSize then return end

    print( ply, "tried to send a", size, "byte", name, "message! Rejecting!" )
    return false
end )

## Performance

We tested Express' performance against two other options:
 - **Manual Chunking**:
   - This is a bare-minimum example script that serializes, compresses, and splits the data up across as few net messages as possible. _(This is typically what people do in smaller addons.)_
   - _[Source](https://gist.github.com/brandonsturgeon/2e73b6e4595dd4476d87494ba4cb73b0#file-sender_chunking-lua)_
 - **NetStream**:
   - This library is very popular. It's the go-to choice for sending large chunks of data. It's currently used by Starfall, PAC3, AdvDupe2, etc.
   - _[Source](https://gist.github.com/brandonsturgeon/2e73b6e4595dd4476d87494ba4cb73b0#file-netstream-lua)_

#### Test Details
<details>
<summary><b>Test Setup</b></summary>

Our findings are based on a series of tests where we generated data sets filled with random elements across a range of data types. (`string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Vector`, `Angle`, `Color`, `Entity`, `table`)

We sent this data using each of the options, one at a time.

These test were performed on a moderately-specced laptop. The server was a dedicated base-branch server run in WSL2. The client was base-branch clean-install run on Windows.

For each test, we collected two key metrics:
- **Duration**: The total time _(in seconds)_ it took to complete each test. This includes compression, serialization, sending, and acknowledgement.
- **Message Count**: The number of net messages sent during the transfer. Fewer is usually better.

**References**:
 - [This](https://gist.github.com/brandonsturgeon/15d195b2a5f8480c6579cc89816d2ac3) is an example of the data sets that we use during the test runs.

#### Test Result Takeaways

- Express sends data significantly faster than both Manual Chunking and NetStream when the data size exceeds a certain threshold _(Roughly whenever 3 or more net messages would be required)_.
- Express only sends up to 2 net messages per transfer, no matter the size of the data.
- Despite its impressive performance with large data sizes, Express is less efficient than other methods for smaller data sizes.
- _(NetStream is surprisingly slow, regardless of data size)_

#### Extra Notes
- These results will depend heavily on networking conditions. For some people, lots of smaller messages may actually perform better than one large Express download.
- Anything that uses the built-in net library _(like NetStream)_ will be more reliable than a library like Express, even if they may be slower overall.
- Express caches sends. This means that if you needed to send a dataset to more than one player, Express would only need to upload the data once, saving a significant amount of time and bandwidth.

These tests illustrate how Express can significantly improve data transfer speed and efficiency for large or even intermediate-scale data, but may underperform when handling smaller data sizes.

Understanding the trade-offs of Express can help you determine if it's a good fit for your project.

## Case Studies

<details>
<summary><h3>Intricate ACF-3 Tank dupe :gun:</h3></summary>
Here's a clip of me spawning a particularly detailed and Prop2Mesh-heavy ACF-3 dupe (both Prop2Mesh and Adv2 use Netstream to transmit their data).

<br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/202295397-047736ce-43e5-4ab3-b741-6f5e7517e6bb.mp4

A few things to note:
 - It took ~20 seconds for the dupe to be transferred to the server via Netstream
 - It took an additional ~20 seconds for the Prop2Mesh data to be Netstreamed back to me
 - On the netgraph, you can see the `in` and `out` metrics (and the associated green horizontal progress bar) that shows Netstream sending each chunk
 - **Netstream only processes one request at a time**. This is important, because it means while Adv2 or Prop2Mesh are transmitting data, no other player can use any Netstream-based addon until it completes.


Using some custom backport code, I converted Prop2Mesh _and_ Advanced Duplicator 2 to use Express instead of Netstream.
Here's me spawning the same tank in the exact same conditions, but using Express instead:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7936439/202296048-d3cbbb32-f3a9-47f3-a42c-6f59fd7f6697.mp4

The entire process took under 15 seconds - that's over 60% faster!
My PC actually lagged for a moment because of how quickly all of the meshes downloaded and were available to render.

Even better? **This doesn't block any other player from spawning their dupes**! Because this is using Express instead of Netstream, other players can freely spawn their dupes, Prop2Mesh, Starfalls, etc. without being blocked and without blocking others.

<summary><h3>Prop2Mesh + Adv2 stress test :test_tube:</h3></summary>
I had someone who knew more about Prop2Mesh than me create a highly complex controller. Here are the stats:

Nearly 1M triangles across 162 models! If you've ever worked with meshes before, you'll know those are crazy high numbers.

When spawning this dupe in a stock server with Adv2 and Prop2Mesh, it takes **nearly 4 minutes**! All the while, blocking other players from using any Netstream-based addon. I can't even upload the video here because it's too big. Hopefully this screenshot is informative enough:

Some metrics:
 - It took 1 minute and 50 seconds before the dupe was even spawnable (it had to send the full dupe over to the server first)
 - After an additional 3 minutes, the meshes were finally downloaded and rendered
 - Again, while this was happening, no other player could use Adv2, Prop2Mesh, or Starfall

With that same backport code, forcing Adv2 and Prop2Mesh to use Express, the entire process **takes under 30 seconds**!
That's almost a **90%** speed increase.

A big thanks to [@thelastpenguin](https://github.com/thelastpenguin) for his [super fast pON encoder](https://github.com/thelastpenguin/gLUA-Library/blob/master/pON/pON-developmental.lua) that lets Express quickly serialize almost every GMod object into a compact message.
