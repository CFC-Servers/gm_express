# 🚄 Express
A lightning-fast networking library for Garry's Mod that allows you to quickly send large amounts of data between server/client with ease.

Seriously, it's really easy! Take a look:
```lua
-- Server
local data = file.Read( "huge_data_file.json" )
express.Broadcast( "stored_data", { data = data })

-- Client
express.Receive( "stored_data", function( data )
    file.Write( "stored_data.json", data.data )
end )
```

In this example, `huge_data_file.json` could be in excess of 100mb without Express even breaking a sweat.
The client would receive the contents of the file as fast as their internet connection can carry it.


## Details
Instead of using Garry's Mod's throttled _(<1mb/s!)_ and already-polluted networking system, Express uses unthrottled HTTP requests to transmit data between the client and server.

Doing it this way comes with a number of practical benefits:
 - 📬 These messages don't run on the main thread, meaning it won't block networking/physics/lua
 - 💪 A dramatic increase to maximum message size (~100mb, compared to the `net` library's 64kb limit)
 - 🏎️ Big improvements to speed in many circumstances
 - 🤙 It's simple! You don't have to worry about serializing, compressing, and splitting your table up. Just send the table!

By default, Express uses a free-forever public API provided by CFC Servers, but anyone can easily host their own!

[The Express Service](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/gm_express_service) is a Cloudflare Workers project, meaning that all of the code runs on Cloudflare's Edge servers.
All data is stored using Cloudflare's K/V system - an ultra low-latency key-value storage tool that enables Express to send large chunks of data as quickly as your internet connection will allow.

**Note:** You'll also need to update the `express_domain` convar to whatever your new domain is. By default it'll probably look like: `gmod-express.<your cloudflare username>.workers.dev`. _(Don't include the protocol, just the raw domain)_

## Usage

### Examples

#### Broadcast a message from Server
```lua
-- Server
-- `data` can be a table of (nearly) any size, and may contain (almost) any values!
-- the recipient will get it exactly like you sent it
local data = ents.GetAll()
express.Broadcast( "all_ents", data )

-- Client
express.Receive( "all_ents", function( data )
    print( "Got " .. #data .. " ents!" )
end )
```

#### Client -> Server
```lua
-- Client
local data = ents.GetAll()
express.Send( "all_ents", data )

-- Server
-- Note that .Receive has `ply` before `data` when called from server
express.Receive( "all_ents", function( ply, data )
    print( "Got " .. #data .. " ents from " .. ply:Nick() )
end )
```

#### Server -> Multiple clients with confirmation callback
```lua
-- Server
local meshData = prop:GetPhysicsObject():GetMesh()
local data = { data = data, entIndex = prop:EntIndex() }

-- Will be called after the player successfully downloads the data
local confirmCallback = function( ply )
    receivedMesh[ply] = true
end

express.Send( "prop_mesh", data, { ply1, ply2, ply3 }, confirmCallback )


-- Client
express.Receive( "prop_mesh", function( data )
    entMeshes[data.entIndex] = data.data
end )
```
